# 🌟 Awesome 60 CSS

Welcome to **Awesome 60 CSS** — a creative challenge where I design and code something beautiful **every day** using just **HTML** and **CSS**, for **60 days straight**!

> 💡 “Creativity is intelligence having fun.” — Albert Einstein

## 🎯 Project Goal

The aim of this project is to:
- Enhance my CSS skills through daily hands-on practice.
- Explore various CSS techniques, animations, layouts, and design patterns.
- Build a library of visually appealing UI elements and micro-interactions.

Each day brings a new concept, a new idea, and a new design — all written from scratch with just **HTML & CSS**.
